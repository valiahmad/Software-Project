# FINAL PROJECT OF BACHELOR'S DEGREE
## Feature Extraction and Sentiment Analysis
This project is divided into two sections, the first one is about implementing **Feature Extraction** that is based on This [paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/11/13/2042), and the second one is about **Sentiment Analysis**.
